# uk-parliament
This is a website I developed which allows users to find their MP and view their voting record. This website Contains Parliamentary information licensed under the Open Parliament Licence v3.0. Developed using React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a number of APIs for querying parliamentary data. 

Overall, this was a very informative project and was a valuable practice in a number of development practices. While far from perfect, I am sharing this to my repository to show my eventual progress. I particularly enjoyed exploring the APIs available from the UK Parliament, as well as coding using React.
